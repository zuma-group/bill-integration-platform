# Tax Information Implementation - ZUM-261

## Overview
Successfully implemented tax type extraction and formatting in the invoice payload according to the business requirements:
- If there is "GST 5%" OR "GST" on the invoice → send as "GST 5%"
- If there is "PST" on the invoice → send as "PST 7%"

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- Added `taxType?: string` field to the `Invoice` interface
- This field stores the tax type label extracted from the invoice (e.g., "GST", "PST", "GST 5%")

### 2. OCR Extraction (`src/lib/gemini.ts`)
- Updated the Gemini AI prompt to extract the tax type from invoices
- The prompt now instructs the AI to look for tax labels like: GST, GST 5%, PST, PST 7%, Sales Tax, etc.
- The extracted tax type is kept as-is from the invoice for accurate processing

### 3. Payload Creation (`src/app/api/push-to-odoo/route.ts`)
- Added `formatTaxDescription()` function that implements the business rules:
  - Any tax type containing "GST" (case-insensitive) → returns "GST 5%"
  - Any tax type containing "PST" (case-insensitive) → returns "PST 7%"
  - Other tax types → returns the original value
  - Null/undefined/empty → returns "Sales Tax" (default)
- Updated the tax line item creation to use the formatted tax description instead of hardcoded "Sales Tax"

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed (no errors)
- ESLint: ✅ Passed (no new warnings)
- Unit tests for `formatTaxDescription()`: ✅ All 12 test cases passed
  - Tested GST variations (GST, GST 5%, gst, GST 7%)
  - Tested PST variations (PST, PST 7%, pst)
  - Tested edge cases (null, undefined, empty string)
  - Tested other tax types (VAT, Sales Tax)

## Impact
- **OCR Processing**: The Gemini AI will now extract tax type information from invoices
- **Payload Format**: Tax line items will have properly formatted descriptions based on the tax type
- **Backward Compatibility**: If no tax type is extracted, the system defaults to "Sales Tax" (existing behavior)

## Example Payloads

### Before (all taxes were "Sales Tax")
```json
{
  "product_code": "TAX",
  "description": "Sales Tax",
  "quantity": 1,
  "unit_price": 50.00,
  "discount": 0,
  "taxes": [],
  "subtotal": 50.00
}
```

### After (with GST on invoice)
```json
{
  "product_code": "TAX",
  "description": "GST 5%",
  "quantity": 1,
  "unit_price": 50.00,
  "discount": 0,
  "taxes": [],
  "subtotal": 50.00
}
```

### After (with PST on invoice)
```json
{
  "product_code": "TAX",
  "description": "PST 7%",
  "quantity": 1,
  "unit_price": 70.00,
  "discount": 0,
  "taxes": [],
  "subtotal": 70.00
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/types/index.ts` - Added taxType field to Invoice interface
2. `src/lib/gemini.ts` - Updated OCR prompt to extract tax type
3. `src/app/api/push-to-odoo/route.ts` - Added formatTaxDescription() function and updated tax line item creation

## Next Steps
- Monitor OCR extraction to ensure tax types are being captured accurately
- If needed, adjust the Gemini prompt for better tax type detection
- Consider adding tax type information to the UI (invoice details view)
