10/17/25, 6:47 PM - Asfand added you
10/17/25, 6:57 PM - Asfand: @⁨Waqas Sultan⁩ - you can connect with @⁨Gocha⁩ for workflow issues. He is our development lead and will be dealing the team directly. He goal is to make everything organized for us and for our partners. 

Just so everyone is aware - 

We are gonna set up KPIs for all our vendors based on their performance.  

For the ERP team - we are setting based on timely delivery and quality. 

The after production issues will impact the numbers we run going forward. Any issues that raise concerns amongst the users will be treated as a negative points towards the evaluation of our vendors/partners. 

The minimum of 90% quality has been to be reached by a vendor in a quarter. 

We will start from 100 going forward. 

Each failure is counted as follows;

1. Failure to deliver on time causes -1 point straight away. 
2. Production failure causes -1 point straight away. 
3. Missing a feature discussed causes -2 points.
4. System down due to poor testing causes -3 points. 
5. Failure to test any task end to end, and making sure its production ready will have be -2 points. 


We believe we are generous with 90%. Hopefully this will clear the air for everyone and this is followed going forward. 

Below 90% will call for an immediate discussion on how to reset. 

Below 85% is immediate termination of contract. 

Thankyou.

10/17/25, 7:42 PM - Gocha: Thanks, Asfand.

Team, the issue Asfand mentioned is exactly the kind of gap we’re going to eliminate going forward.

Starting today, I’ll be reviewing the current workflow and active tasks closely.

Over the next few days, I’ll introduce new processes to keep everything organized, on schedule, and up to our quality standards.

These will make tracking, reporting, and delivery smoother for everyone.

I’ll also reach out to each of you individually to review your ongoing work and align on how we’ll operate moving forward.

10/23/25, 4:17 PM - +92 341 2454273: Its how this notification has been implemented at the corr of odoo. Such things are not made to be easily customisable. It may take time to explore.
10/23/25, 4:17 PM - +92 335 2892466: It works fine on runbot
10/23/25, 4:18 PM - +92 341 2454273: Ammar tested there. I think it was same there
10/23/25, 4:18 PM - +92 341 2454273: Let us check again
10/23/25, 4:19 PM - +92 341 2454273: If it does, then matching our odoo build to their build will be enough.

1. On the PO tree and form, there should be a field Total Billed Balance

So lets say if the PO is 500

There is a bill against it for 250 

The total billed amount would be 250 

Balance would be 250
10/23/25, 5:56 PM - +92 335 2892466: Also, when we submit file from the API it doesn't fetch on the Odoo task

11/3/25, 10:59 PM - +92 341 2454273: let me know if it is fine. shouldn't take more then a few sec time
11/3/25, 10:59 PM - Asfand: Can it automatically pick it up?
11/3/25, 10:59 PM - Asfand: Based on the company
11/3/25, 10:59 PM - Asfand: Like whoever is the user
11/3/25, 10:59 PM - +92 341 2454273: which company? contacts company or the currently active company?
11/3/25, 11:00 PM - Asfand: Like if it has an active company
11/3/25, 11:00 PM - Asfand: It should just pick up the sales team according to the user
11/3/25, 11:00 PM - Asfand: Whatever it could pick up on CRM
11/3/25, 11:01 PM - +92 341 2454273: ok. let me see. like, currently which ever user saves the record, it auto picks that user as sales person, same thing we will do for team. let me see whats the best way for taht

11/3/25, 11:06 PM - +92 341 2454273: I think making a default sales team on company level would be the most straight forward way. crm uses some complex logic for sales team selection,
11/3/25, 11:06 PM - Asfand: Okay, do we need to add that somewhere
11/3/25, 11:07 PM - +92 341 2454273: yes, as of now, there is no field for default sales tema.
11/3/25, 11:42 PM - +92 341 2454273: company level mei field bnani hai, or us ki waja se down time ae ga lazmi, foran up nhi hoga.

11/4/25, 3:46 PM - Asfand: And if a customer already in the system, its not letting you go forward
11/4/25, 3:47 PM - Asfand: What was the last code you guys push?
11/4/25, 3:48 PM - +92 341 2454273: Yes, development is wrong. If we don’t carry forward company, it would not allow to create opportunity, 

While the development relied on putting company after opportunity being created.
11/4/25, 3:49 PM - Asfand: @⁨Ammar Ahmed Khan⁩ - The last changes you guys pushed
11/4/25, 3:49 PM - Asfand: Is that the issue?
11/4/25, 3:49 PM - Asfand: I need this running somehow for now
11/4/25, 3:50 PM - Asfand: Without this sales people cant take proper calls
11/4/25, 3:50 PM - Asfand: So whatever needs to happen for now
11/4/25, 3:50 PM - Asfand: Should be good
11/4/25, 3:51 PM - Asfand: We can deploy a proper fix tomorrow
11/4/25, 3:57 PM - Asfand: What is the plan? @amm
11/4/25, 3:57 PM - Asfand: @⁨Ammar Ahmed Khan⁩
11/4/25, 3:57 PM - +92 341 2454273: Checking old code. Wait
11/4/25, 4:00 PM - Asfand: Also, can we remove the code which causes dual activities? Don’t create an activity when opportunity is created
11/4/25, 4:05 PM - +92 341 2454273: We have checked the recent code. Last thing was done 2 weeks ago. 

Previously, opportunity was getting current company id, and contacts don’t have any company tagged on them(bug since start). that was causing the error.  As a fix, developer picked company from contact instead. 


Permanent fix is to get company over contact.. needs to be done.
11/4/25, 4:07 PM - Asfand: Are you guys going to fix it?
11/4/25, 4:08 PM - Asfand: Can we revert back to whatever it was because it was working okayish
11/4/25, 4:43 PM - Ammar Ahmed Khan: <Media omitted>
11/4/25, 4:50 PM - Asfand: Is it from the message screen or the general screen?
11/4/25, 4:50 PM - +92 341 2454273: @⁨Asfand⁩ take a message ka scenario phas ra hai. 


You have a contact in zuma sales, 

You are standing in zuma sales or zuma lift(doesn’t matter in this case) , 

During take a message you select zuma lift. It will give error, contact of zuma sales cannot have opportunity in lift.
11/4/25, 4:51 PM - Asfand: Which is fine, unless we can just trigger a record in the other company
11/4/25, 4:51 PM - Asfand: Somehow
11/4/25, 4:51 PM - Asfand: If all other scenarios are working, lets push them
11/4/25, 4:52 PM - +92 341 2454273: Its not a trigger issue, trigger can be done, 

But in this case, we are making sales opportunity for lift customer. Its record conflict not access issue.
11/4/25, 4:53 PM - Asfand: Yeah, I mean if it a different company the record should be made regardless of where you are
11/4/25, 4:54 PM - Asfand: User can see it in the log note
11/4/25, 4:55 PM - +92 341 2454273: Ye cheez nhi smja. VN kr do
11/4/25, 4:58 PM - +92 341 2454273: Lets leave this scenario and fix rest. Then once others are fixed, we will focus on this
11/4/25, 5:22 PM - Asfand: Okay
11/4/25, 5:22 PM - Asfand: Can we push this
11/4/25, 5:25 PM - Ammar Ahmed Khan: testing on staging currently.
11/4/25, 7:12 PM - Asfand: what is the update?
11/4/25, 7:16 PM - Ammar Ahmed Khan: available to connect?
